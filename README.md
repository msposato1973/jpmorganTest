J.P Morgan Java Technical Test

For this project is designed to work with a Data.csv file, located in the directory
C:\\Data.csv.

Within the code, there are also additional methods for multifunctional use, sorting methods, grouping method by entity.

As a development tool I used eclipse version oxygen, the java versa used to develop is jdk7
The main class is ExecuteMain.java (class calls the method main)

/*
JPExecutionReport excute=new JPExecutionReport();
System.out.println( "I will use a default file in C:\\Data.csv ");
*/

where the code calls "excute.loadData()".

I have also implemented the same version that calls the same media passing the file pattern.
But at the moment not invoked, since the file that you pass should be of the same formatting as the one that accepts.
